 * Dispatch the given `eventType` DOM event on the target element matched by the provided selector.
 * The selector argument accepts 3 different types of value:
 *  - If it's a string, then it's treated as an HTML selector by which to find the target element
 *    to fire the event on. If no element is found for the provided selector,
 *    then an error will be thrown.
 *  - If it's an {@link EventTarget} such as {@link Element} or {@link window},
 *    then the event is fired directly on it.
 *  - If it's a {@link DebugElement}, then its native element will be dispatched the event on.
 *
 * @param selector HTML selector to match.
 * @param eventType DOM element type such as `click`, `pointerup`, etc.
 * @param eventDetail Optional event detail to include such as the key code for keyboard event.
